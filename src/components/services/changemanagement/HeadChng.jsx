          Businesses are juggling the energy crisis, inflation, supply chain
          strain, a competitive labour market, and a growing skills divide. In
          order to unleash growth amid disruption, workforce transformation is a
          purposeful development of skills, competences, and organisational
          hardwiring.

          People's connections with work have been prompted to reevaluate by
          global change, disruption, the well-being revolution, and a new
          generation of workers. However, leaders tend to underestimate how much
          their people are related, often overestimating it by a factor of two.

        <h2>Talent transformation in a world of uncertainty</h2>
        <p>
          Organizations are navigating the energy crisis, supply chain stress,
          inflation, a tight talent market and a widening skills gap. Workforce
          transformation is a strategic evolution of skills, capabilities and
          organizational hardwiring to unlock growth amid disruption.

          Customer, workforce and shareholder expectations have vaulted
          Inclusion, Diversity & Equity (ID&E) as a major priority for C-suite
          leaders. Businesses are under great pressure to deliver value for all
          shareholders: to turn their responsible goals into actions and create
          lasting impact. Those that succeed are sustainable organizations which
          embrace ID&E at their core.
