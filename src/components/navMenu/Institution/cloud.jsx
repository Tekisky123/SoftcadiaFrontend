      <h2 style={{textAlign:"center"}}>The next leg of the cloud journey to resilience</h2>
      <p>Organizations have responded to recent disruption with rapid cloud and digital transformation. While they have boosted resilience, they must now reinvent for greater integration under a cohesive cloud strategy to realize delayed value and tighten costs.</p>

      <h3>A tipping point to full cloud value</h3>
      <p>With more than 86% of companies reporting an increase in cloud initiatives since 2020, only 42% report fully achieving the outcomes they expected. The most elusive of them all? Cost savings, which take a starring role amid economic uncertainty. 
       <br />
       Caught between the promise of large-scale cloud transformation and the complexity that must be addressed to realize it, including rethinking operating models, talent, etc., organizations face a tipping point: They've picked the low-hanging fruit of cloud but must now double down to achieve its full value. How do we know? Because the ones who achieve outcomes more often are heavy adopters who see cloud as a continuously evolving journey, not a destination.

       <br />

       Naturally, the further you go, the more complex the challenges. Understand the barriers to cloud value and learn five practices that will help you move beyond them.

        <h3>Untangling value from chaos via cloud</h3>
        <p>
        In times of uncertainty, the most agile businesses are the ones that survive and thrive. What do they all have in common? High interoperability.
        <br />
        Interoperability is when enterprise applications seamlessly interact and exchange data, connecting technology, people and processes to improve collaboration and decision-making. 
According to our research, companies with high interoperability grew revenue six times faster than peers with low interoperability and unlocked an additional five percentage points in annual revenue growth. 
<br />
Replatforming to cloud brings your organization unprecedented interoperability. By modernizing operations on a common platform, you can run, experiment and innovate with greater speed and agility to lower costs, optimize spend and improve resilience.

Learn more about how to level up interoperability for long-term value with cloud.

<h3>Build your core for breakthrough resilience</h3>
<p>
In light of the current economic climate, businesses are redefining their imperatives around cost efficiency, growth and agility. They know the pace of change calls for continuous reinvention to remain resilient, but many find themselves hamstringed by a familiar foe.
<br />
Legacy technology is one of the biggest agility killers, limiting your ability to change and innovate. To address that, organizations must build a strong digital core around cloud, AI and metaverse. Together, these technologies not only help you continuously reinvent to weather uncertaintyâ€”they also help you capitalize on opportunities along the way through breakthrough innovation.
