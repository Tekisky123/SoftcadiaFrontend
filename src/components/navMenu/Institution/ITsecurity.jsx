      <p>The economy is on the minds of business leaders. C-suites recognize survival depends upon the ability to safeguard systems and information. They need to redesign for resilienceâ€”mitigate risk, strategically deploy assets and investments and assign accountability.</p>

      <p>A key part of rapid digitalization, fueled by the pandemic, is accelerated cloud adoption. Together, digitalization and the Cloud Continuum have redefined not only enterprise boundaries and capabilities but also the attack surface, adding vulnerabilities that are beyond the reach of traditional responses. We cover common security blindspots, from automation to talent shortages and outline two routes to the cloud, each with their own risks and approaches.
