        Insurers traditionally provide monetary protection against damages to life and property. In the last decade, however, they've expanded their strategies to include prevention and preservation. Prevention informs the insured of potential dangers while preservation ensures continuity and perpetuity. Covering this full spectrum—from protection to preservation—requires a flexible business model and a digital-first strategy.

        <h2>Why insurers will be key to a just net zero transition </h2>
        <p>
        The insurance industry worldwide is set to play a pivotal role in the transition to a low-carbon economy.
        <br /><br />
        To ensure a just net-zero transition, insurers must address protection gaps as they navigate climate risks.
