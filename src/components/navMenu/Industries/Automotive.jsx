              <h3>Addressing macroeconomic challenges in the automotive industry</h3>
              <p>Disrupted supply chains, raw material and energy cost volatility means that Automotive OEMs need a clear strategy to leverage new business models, make sustainability a true market differentiator and transform costs and investments.
              A structural reinvention of the organizational model means being willing to rethink organizational boundaries, processes and roles. It allows companies to ask: How would they set up their business today? Which functions are necessary at the local market level and which can be centralized to efficiently support local market organizations? A zero-based approach helps businesses focus on future needs.

              <p>The Automotive industry, as we previously understood it, is obsolete. We are now operating in a Mobility ecosystem: the next iteration of Automotive.

Today’s megatrends are raising fundamental questions about the purpose of a vehicle—advances in connected and autonomous technology, the shift from hardware to software-defined vehicle, an emphasis on sustainability, and ever-changing customer expectations—pose threats to traditional automakers and also present exciting new opportunities.

All of this is creating a new value chain for the automotive industry. In this next iteration of Automotive, companies must get creative about how they reshape their products, structure their businesses, use technology, and reimagine the services and experiences they bring to their customers.</p>
