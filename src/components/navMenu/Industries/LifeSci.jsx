      <h2>Building ecosystems for better health outcomes</h2>
      <p>Life sciences companies no longer just make drugs and devices. The focus now is on patient-centric ecosystems that accelerate innovation to ensure personalized medical services. The future will see an integration of transformative technologies like digital twins, virtual clinical trials, digital surgery, 3-D printing, blockchain, 5G, and quantum computing to deliver on the promise of healthy and enriched lives for all.

      <h2>The business of human microbiome</h2>
      <p>The innumerable microorganisms present on the earth have complex implications for the planet and human health.  
Acknowledging the human microbiome modality is vital for the pharma industry as companies are expected to adopt advanced drug and diagnostic technologies, diversify their product portfolios, and create new growth avenues for new solutions. 
Affordability and miniaturization of DNA sequencing technology is fast paving the way for commoditization of the microbiome-based wellness market. 
A single large-scale microbiome research project can generate terabytes of data. Managing, processing, and analyzing this data, requires both computational and domain expertise.
We are looking at a future of accessibility, wherein consumers would profile and analyze their personalized microbiome, and receive lifestyle and dietary recommendations through hand-held devices. This means, massive data streams are expected in the future.
Biology-informed algorithms rooted in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing can unlock clinical intelligence hidden in complex microbial genomes, reactomes, and metabolic networks.
If the previous decade was about microbiome research, the world is now poised to enter the era of the microbiome business.</p>

      <h2>Transforming systematic literature reviews</h2>
      <p>The methodologies like systematic literature reviews (SLR), real world evidence (RWE), and others support regulatory, clinical, and policy-level decision-making. The amalgamation of SLR with RWE and other quantitative techniques represents the highest level of evidence generation. 

The future of evidence generation will be complex; the current process of generating SLR is manual and highly dependent on developed countries.

Thus, researchers and policymakers demand technology levels to optimize the end-to-end SLR process. The industry must invest in smart, intelligent, and connected technology to transform the existing manual process.

The industry is witnessing increased adoption of SLR as a critical evidence-generation and decision-making tool. SLR offers several benefits, like comprehensive and summarize views on any question related to scientific research, to understand research gaps and identify areas of improvement in future work.
